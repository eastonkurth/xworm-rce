please **use this responsibly** and only test it on urself. this is made for people wondering how xworm works or are just curious to try stuff out
and plz credit if you skid this

# information

usage: python rce.py -H host -p port -k (option defaults to the default xworm key

how it works: since XWORM runs powershell on the threat actors computer to make a rdp profile using HRDP (i honestly forgot some because we made this 2 weeks ago) we can use that to run our own powershell code.

where to find c2s: solara discord, malwarebazaar, anyrun, ratting servers (some 'cracked rats' are backdoored), github (search for cracked rats)
